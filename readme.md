# Specialist Pools Rebalance
Overhauls the specialist pools for the four neutral traders Diana, Valeria, Procurator and Manx by removing low value specialists and categorising the rest based on the trader.

Each of the four traders now has a manually curated list of specialists taken from the combined pools of the neutral traders, pirates and rival npcs. This does not include the legendaries from research or from conquering/appointing other rival NPCs.

Valeria now has the civilian ship captains and The Procurator has all military specialists (captains and land buffs like towers and camps).

Diana and Manx provide all the other specialists largely divided by region to minimise overlap and make it easier to get a specific specialist.

## What specialists have been Removed
The entire category of area buffs such as all bakeries in range of the specialist apply +1 fire safety to all buildings in range. These buffs mostly conflict with the main game design goal of spreading your production throughout a city and only really make sense for intermediate production zones. They're still very questionable value so have been entirely removed.

The common and rare productivity and maintanence specialists. This may be a bit more contentious, but from my perspective these are quite low value due to the productivity bonus being only 10/20% and the maintanence bonuses only applying to the lowest tiers of workers. The issue with this is that buildings that use tier 1 and 2 workers tend to only use a few workers, so a -35% buff makes such a small difference that it doesn't seem worth it. The productivity bonuses are also heavily diluted because the game encourages you to use the massive bonuses from religion and aqueducts instead.

The city watch specialists have been removed as the limitation of only affecting their respective buildings within range of the villa/officium makes them nearly useless.

If you use my other mod City Watch Specialist Rework they will be automatically added back into Manx's specialist pool.

## What specialists remain
All captains and military land based specialists are still present but have been divided up between the Procurator and Valeria.

The epic tier productivity and maintanence specialists have been kept as a 35% boost to productivity is quite notable and the worforce reduction starts to make more sense when eques and patrician buildings use much greater amounts of workforce and upkeep.

Basic residence bonuses for the main seven attributes income/belief/knowledge/prestige/fire safety/health/happiness. These are simple but effective, even if you phase them out later in the game for more specialised buffs.

Residence buffs for providing specific needs. These are quite powerful and are good at encouraging providing all needs to all residences.

Some other smaller categories include aqueduct buffs, workforce buffs, workforce swaps for certain buildings and some public service building buffs.

All legendaries are still available and have been categorised accordingly.

# Who has what Specialist
The categorisation of specialists has been designed to make intuitive sense where possible with some small concessions between Diana and Manx to even the pools out a bit.

There is no overlap between traders except that Diana and Manx share most of their legendaries, except the small few that boost only their respective regions workforce. These are split accordingly.

## Valeria
Valeria now has all civilian ship captains with buffs like ship speed, cargo transfer speed, region transfer speed etc.

## The Procurator
The Procurator now has all military ship captains with buffs to weapons or damage slowdown etc.

He also has all the land based military specialists that buff recruitment times, various tower buffs etc.

## Diana
Diana has all Latium goods based buffs along with the basic residence buffs for money/knowledge/prestige/happiness.

## Manx
Manx has all Albion goods based buffs along with the basic residence buffs for belief/fire safety/health.

If you use my other mod City Watch Specialist Rework, they will also be added into Manx's specialist pool.

## Total Number of Specialists at each Trader
|Trader|Amount|
|Valiera|25|
|The Procurator|50|
|Diana|69|
|Manx|59*|

\* Manx has 68 if City Watch Specialist Rework is installed

# Future Comaptibility
This mod is not going to be useful in future unless it is manually updated with new specialists and probably new traders.

I spent hours identifying, extracting, categorising and then analysing and curating all these specialists manually and I cannot promise I will want to do that multiple times again in the future as updates and DLC is added.

If someone else wants to use this mod as a framework for doing the same thing with their own idea of balance you are more than welcome. I have left my internal lists that I used inside the mod files both for myself and anyone else who can benefit from them.
